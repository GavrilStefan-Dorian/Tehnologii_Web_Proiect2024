      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Boo's web platform features 15 thoughtfully designed pages aimed at enhancing the reading journey for all users. With a clear and user-friendly architecture, Boo ensures seamless navigation through a cohesive header that adapts with either a sidebar or navbar depending on the device. This approach prioritizes accessibility and usability, underscoring Boo's commitment to enriching the reading experience through interactive tools and community engagement.</p>
      <section class="component-1">
        <h3>The sidebar & navbar</h3>
        <p>
          This sidebar facilitates
          access to app's pages, and the user may horizontally scroll through for all the buttons.
        </p>
        <figure type="sa:image">
          <img src="images/header.png" alt="header-img" />

          <figcaption>Mobile navbar & Main Page</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          For the profile icon and logout button to appear, the user must be logged into their
          account.

          For the admin button to appear, user must be a registered administrator of the application, and must have their role cookie set to 'admin'.
        </p>
        <p>
          To check if the user is logged in, we verify a cookie with the user's JSON Web Token.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the logout functionality, the Logout will destroy the user's JWT and unset it from the Browser Cookies.

        <h3>The <code>Home</code> page</h3>
        <p>
          As previously shown, the home page of the application presents various books based on disting rankings. Choosing to visit the page of any book will redirect the user to that according URL. The user may browse through the lists of books through horizontal scrolling. They may also view all the books for a particular list.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="component-3">
        <h3>The <code>Login</code> page</h3>
        <p>
          For features such as reviews, liking and bookmarking a book, joining groups, users must log in to their account in our
          database. This is the page users are redirected to if not logged in when attempting to access restricted pages. 
          The login requires an email and password. The page also has redirects for the Sign up and Forgot Password pages, in case the user may need them.

        <p>
          For this page, the login endpoint is used. The Login endpoint allows
          users to log in and obtain a JWT. POST requests are used for submitting user data. GET requests are used for receiving the HTML page.
